# non-pipelined-and-a-pipelined-8086
compare the execution times of a non-pipelined and a pipelined 8086 processor for a specified number of instructions.

Pipelining and non-pipelining are contrasting approaches to organizing and executing tasks, especially in the context of computer architecture and processing systems.

### Pipelined:
In a pipelined architecture, tasks or instructions are divided into a sequence of stages, each handling a specific operation. These stages are arranged in a pipeline, and multiple instructions can be processed simultaneously. As one stage completes its task, the output is passed to the next stage, allowing for continuous execution of instructions without waiting for the entire process of one instruction to finish before starting the next. Pipelining enhances throughput and overall system efficiency by parallelizing the execution of different instructions.

### Non-pipelined:
In contrast, a non-pipelined architecture processes tasks or instructions sequentially, one at a time, without overlapping operations. Each instruction must complete its entire execution before the next one begins. While this straightforward approach can be conceptually simpler, it may result in underutilized resources and longer overall processing times. Non-pipelined architectures are less able to exploit parallelism and may experience more significant idle periods in the execution of tasks.

In summary, pipelining introduces parallelism by breaking down tasks into stages and processing multiple instructions simultaneously, while non-pipelined systems execute tasks sequentially without overlapping operations. The choice between these architectures depends on the specific requirements of a given system and the balance between simplicity and performance optimization.

## This Java program
is designed to simulate and compare the execution times of a non-pipelined and a pipelined 8086 processor for a specified number of instructions. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. User Input:

   * The program starts by prompting the user to enter the number of instructions to be simulated for both pipelined and non-pipelined scenarios.

2. Non-Pipelined Simulation:

   * The user is then prompted to enter the clock cycles required for each of the four stages (IF, ID, EX, WB) for each instruction.
   * The input is validated to ensure positive integers are entered.
   * The total number of clock cycles required for non-pipelined execution (TNP) is calculated.

3. Pipelined Simulation:

   * The program then simulates pipelined execution by applying the pipeline stages (IF, ID, EX, WB) to each instruction.
   * The execution time of the pipelined scenario is determined, and the result is stored in the variable TP.

4. Results Display:

   * The program then displays the clock cycle table for both the non-pipelined and pipelined scenarios.
   * It also prints out the total execution times for both scenarios (TNP for non-pipelined and TP for pipelined).
   * Finally, it calculates and displays the speedup achieved by pipelining.

5. Utility Methods:

   * Apply_pipeline: A method for updating the pipeline array based on the given instruction, clock cycles, and operation.
   * MAX_INDEX and MAX_INDEX_AtValue: Methods to find the index of the maximum value and the index of a specified value in an array, respectively.
   * Print: A utility method to print a 2D array.

6. Exception Handling:

   * The program includes exception handling to deal with invalid inputs such as non-integer values.
Note: The code assumes that the user provides valid input and does not perform extensive error checking beyond basic validation. Additionally, the simulation is a simplified representation and may not capture all aspects of real-world processor behavior.
